#  UCLA Machine Learning Model

## Project Overview

This project involves building a machine learning pipeline for a dataset associated with UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) research or study purposes. The primary goal is to develop a model using structured data, visualize its performance, and deploy it via a user-friendly web interface.

### **Goal**:
- Build a predictive model using machine learning.
- Visualize the results and provide real-time predictions using a web app.

### **Machine Learning Task**:
- **Task Type**: (Classification or Regression) *(You can specify this based on your use case)*  
- **Target Variable**: `Target_Column_Name` *(Replace with actual target)*  
- **Success Criteria**: High accuracy or low error depending on task type.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project includes columns like:

- **Feature_1**, **Feature_2**, ..., **Feature_n**: Input features relevant to the prediction task.
- **Target**: The column we aim to predict (classification label or regression target).

*(Replace these with actual column names and types once defined.)*
